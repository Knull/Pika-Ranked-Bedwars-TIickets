Server must be Minecraft related (exceptions can be made, e.g., for performance enhancing softwares).
- **Server must have 1,000+ members. (In this case, we'll do a NoPing4Ping partnership, where you have to ping for our advertisement but we won't)**
- **For a Ping4Ping or a partnership with a smaller server, the prices are given below:**
\`\`\`arm
1. Simple Ping4Ping partnership, if your server is above 1000 members will cost $15 USD.
2. A Ping4Ping partnership with smaller servers may cost up to $20 USD.
3. A Ping4Ping CAN BE FREE for servers with 1.25x the number of members of PRBW.
4. A simple partnership with no pings for servers of any member count will cost $10 USD.
